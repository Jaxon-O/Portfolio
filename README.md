# Web Portfolio for Jaxon O'Connell
## Overview
Welcome to my development repository for my web based portfolio. The portfolio currently uses plain HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end and Django for back-end. The portfolio links my different accounts (Github, LinkedIn etc) and CV all in one place, as well as some unrelated back-end development that I use for testing and learning. In the future, I plan to add my projects and allow interaction with them through the Portfolio site.

## Installation
As the site is still in development, it is not live yet. To view the current development site, it must be installed locally. Here are the instructions:
* Install python 3 and pip on your machine
* Pull the repository and move into the Portfolio directory
* Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start the server with `py manage.py runserver`

Now, the server should be running on your localhost at port 8000. To view it, go to [127.0.0.1:8000/members](127.0.0.1:8000/members). The /members is the current home directory.
